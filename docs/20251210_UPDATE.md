# Daily Update - December 10, 2025

## 🎯 Session Goals
- Initialize project structure for productivity & task management web app
- Set up backend (Node.js + Express)
- Set up frontend (React + Vite)
- Create beautiful login page and home page
- Implement basic authentication flow

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- ✅ Created `docs/` folder with three key documentation files:
  - `features.md` - Complete feature roadmap for long-term planning
  - `architecture.md` - Technical architecture and design decisions
  - `20251210_UPDATE.md` - This daily update file

### 2. Backend Development
- ✅ Created `backend/` folder with Node.js + Express
- ✅ Installed dependencies: `express`, `cors`, `nodemon`
- ✅ Set up project structure:
  - `server.js` - Main Express server (runs on port 5000)
  - `routes/auth.js` - Authentication endpoints (login, logout)
  - `routes/tasks.js` - Task management endpoints (CRUD operations)
  - `data/users.js` - Hardcoded user data (temporary)
  - `data/tasks.js` - Hardcoded tasks data (temporary)

#### Backend Features Implemented:
- Simple session-based authentication
- Token generation and validation
- User login/logout endpoints
- Task CRUD API endpoints
- CORS enabled for React frontend communication

#### Demo Users Available:
- Email: `demo@example.com` / Password: `demo123`
- Email: `john@example.com` / Password: `password`

### 3. Frontend Development
- ✅ Created `frontend/` folder with React + Vite
- ✅ Installed dependencies: `react`, `react-router-dom`, `axios`
- ✅ Set up project structure:
  - `src/App.jsx` - Main app with routing logic
  - `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Beautiful login page
  - `src/pages/Home.jsx` - Home dashboard page
  - `src/utils/api.js` - API client for backend communication
  - Corresponding CSS files for each page

#### Frontend Features Implemented:
- **Login Page:**
  - Clean, modern design following design guidelines
  - Email/password form
  - "Fill Demo Credentials" button for easy testing
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Smooth animations and transitions

- **Home Page:**
  - Left sidebar navigation with:
    - Today, Backlog, Pomodoro, Statistics menu items
    - User profile section
    - Logout button
  - Main content area with:
    - Personalized greeting with current date
    - Daily Highlight section (placeholder)
    - Tasks section (displays user tasks)
    - Quick Stats dashboard (placeholder)
  - Fully responsive layout
  - Following design system: Inter font, mint/coral colors, rounded corners, soft shadows

- **Authentication Flow:**
  - Login redirects to home when authenticated
  - Home redirects to login when not authenticated
  - Token stored in localStorage
  - Protected routes implementation

---

## 🎨 Design Implementation

Successfully followed all design guidelines:
- ✅ Color Palette: Mint (#4ECB71) primary, Coral (#FD8D6E) accent, soft backgrounds
- ✅ Typography: Inter font, clean hierarchy
- ✅ UI Components: Rounded corners (16px), soft shadows, 24px+ padding
- ✅ Modern, calm, friendly aesthetic
- ✅ Card-based layout with breathing room
- ✅ Subtle hover effects and animations (200ms ease)

---

## 📦 Technology Stack

### Backend:
- Node.js v24.11.1
- Express.js v5.2.1
- CORS enabled
- Nodemon for development

### Frontend:
- React 18+ with Vite
- React Router DOM v6
- Axios for HTTP requests
- CSS Modules for styling

### Data Storage:
- Currently: Hardcoded in-memory (backend/data/)
- Future: Will migrate to database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Server runs on `http://localhost:5000`

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
App runs on `http://localhost:5173`

### Login Credentials:
- Email: `demo@example.com`
- Password: `demo123`

---

## 🔄 Current Status

### What Works:
- ✅ Backend server running with API endpoints
- ✅ Frontend React app with routing
- ✅ User can log in with demo credentials
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive login page
- ✅ Home dashboard with sidebar navigation
- ✅ Tasks fetched from backend and displayed
- ✅ Logout functionality

### What's Placeholder:
- Daily Highlight (UI only, not functional yet)
- Task actions (Start, Edit buttons visible but not connected)
- Quick Stats (shows 0s, not calculating yet)
- Sidebar menu items (Today, Backlog, etc. - UI only)
- Add Task button (visible but not functional)

---

## 💡 Notes & Learnings

1. **PowerShell Syntax:** Windows PowerShell uses `;` instead of `&&` for chaining commands
2. **Simple Start:** Kept authentication simple (no password hashing yet) for learning purposes
3. **Hardcoded Data:** Using in-memory storage for now - data resets when server restarts
4. **Design First:** Focused on beautiful, calm UI from the start - sets the tone for the app
5. **Incremental Approach:** Only implemented login + home view as requested - ready for feature-by-feature expansion

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- **Sidebar Navigation:** Fixed sidebar for easy access to main features
- **Card-Based Layout:** All content in rounded, shadowed cards for visual hierarchy
- **Coral for Priority:** Using accent color sparingly for important items
- **Empty States:** Friendly empty state messages to guide user
- **Responsive First:** Mobile-friendly from day one

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Data Persistence:** Server restart clears all data (expected, will add DB later)
2. **No Password Hashing:** Plain text passwords in hardcoded data (will fix with DB)
3. **No Form Validation:** Minimal validation on task creation (will improve)
4. **Navigation Placeholder:** Sidebar menu items don't navigate yet (coming soon)
5. **No Error Boundary:** Global error handling to be added
